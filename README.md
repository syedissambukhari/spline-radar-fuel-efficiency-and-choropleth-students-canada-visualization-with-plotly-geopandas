# Data Visualization with Plotly and GeoPandas

This repository contains two data visualization projects using Plotly and GeoPandas:

## Project 1: Spline Radar Plot with Fuel Efficiency Data

Re-create the radar plot using Plotly and the fuel-efficiency.csv data set. The radar plot uses a smooth curve to join the points, called a spline.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `spline-radar-fuel-efficiency` directory.
3. Open the `fuel_efficiency_plot.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to view and run the visualization.
4. Explore the code to understand the spline radar plot creation.
5. Optionally, modify the code or dataset as needed.

## Project 2: Choropleth Map with Students Data in Canada

Re-create the choropleth map using GeoPandas and the students.csv data set. The map of Canada is given in the canada.shp file and associated files. The color map uses the “Reds” color map from ColorBrewer.

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the `choropleth-students-canada` directory.
2. Open the `choropleth_map.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to view and run the visualization.
3. Explore the code to understand the choropleth map creation.
4. Optionally, modify the code or dataset as needed.
